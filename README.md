**CI/CD -CM/CD**
Deployment, Monitoring, Maintenance

Start with practical problem 
Ride cancellations
Fraud detection
Recommendation model
Classifying images for actual usecase?

Track your experiments while building the models

Mlflow, Weights & Biases, organized spreadsheet

Reproducibility and iteration
Evaluate with sensible metrics => precision and recall
Whats the cost of false negative and false positives
Deployment
Streamliy, gradios, fastapi
Add monitoring / clear plan
How would you detect model’s performance if it degrades?
When would you retrain it?
